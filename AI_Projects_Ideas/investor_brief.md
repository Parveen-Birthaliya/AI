## STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK: FUTURE-PREDICTED METHODS

### Timeline Waves
**Wave 1 (2025-2028)**: Near-term AI applications - 40% viable today
**Wave 2 (2028-2032)**: AGI-adjacent services - 30% viable with AGI
**Wave 3 (2032-2035)**: Post-AGI economy - 20% requires technological breakthroughs
**Wave 4 (2035+)**: Speculative/transformative - 10% requires paradigm shifts

### Investment Risk Profile
- **Low Risk** (Methods 1-50): Extensions of current AI capabilities
- **Medium Risk** (Methods 51-100): Require AGI or major breakthroughs
- **High Risk** (Methods 101-150): Require multiple breakthrough technologies
- **Extreme Risk** (Methods 151-200): Speculative, may be impossible

### Market Size Projection
- **Methods 1-50**: $10T+ addressable market by 2030
- **Methods 51-100**: $100T+ addressable market by 2035
- **Methods 101-200**: Potentially infinite in post-scarcity scenarios

### Billionaire-Level Strategy

**Portfolio Allocation (2025-2035)**:
- **70%**: Near-term methods (1-50) - Cash flow and credibility
- **20%**: Mid-term methods (51-100) - Position for AGI transition
- **8%**: Far-term methods (101-150) - Asymmetric upside bets
- **2%**: Speculative (151-200) - Lottery tickets on paradigm shifts

### Key Assumptions
1. **AGI Timeline**: 2027-2032 (most methods 51+ depend on this)
2. **Regulatory**: Assumes relatively permissive AI regulation
3. **Social Acceptance**: Many methods require cultural shifts
4. **Technical Feasibility**: Some methods may be physically impossible
5. **Ethical Frameworks**: Assumes resolution of AI alignment

### Critical Uncertainties
- **AGI Alignment**: Misaligned AGI makes most methods irrelevant
- **Regulatory Capture**: Could slow or stop many innovations
- **Social Backlash**: Could limit adoption of transformative tech
- **Economic Disruption**: Post-AGI economy may not function as predicted
- **Existential Risk**: Some methods themselves pose risks

### Moats in Future Markets
1. **Data Moats**: Proprietary training data (near-term)
2. **Alignment Moats**: Safe AI systems (mid-term)
3. **Compute Moats**: Access to massive compute (near/mid)
4. **First Mover**: Being first in post-AGI markets
5. **Network Effects**: Standards and ecosystems
6. **Regulatory**: Compliance in high-risk areas
7. **Ethical**: Trust in handling transformative tech

### Optionality Strategy
**Maximum optionality approach**:
1. Build fast-monetizing methods (1-20) immediately
2. Develop expertise in AGI-adjacent domains
3. Create modular assets that pivot across scenarios
4. Maintain flexible capital allocation
5. Build reputation and network in AI/futurism circles

### Exit Scenarios
- **Near-term** (Methods 1-50): Traditional M&A, $10M-$1B exits
- **Mid-term** (Methods 51-100): Strategic acquisition by AGI labs, $100M-$10B
- **Far-term** (Methods 101+): May not have traditional exits in post-scarcity economy

### Contrarian Insights
1. **Most valuable methods**: Those viable immediately before AGI arrives
2. **Biggest risk**: Over-investing in post-AGI when AGI timing uncertain
3. **Hidden value**: Methods that work well in both AGI/no-AGI scenarios
4. **Defensive plays**: Methods that help navigate AI transition risks
5. **Meta-strategy**: Betting on multiple timelines simultaneously

**Document Classification**: CONFIDENTIAL - Billionaire Research Intelligence
**Focus**: Future-Predicted Methods (2025-2035+)
**Last Updated**: November 2025
**Investment Thesis**: Bet on the transition, not just the destination
**Warning**: Methods 101+ are highly speculative. Methods 151+ may be science fiction.
**Recommendation**: Focus on methods 1-50 while positioning for 51-100. Treat 101+ as intellectual exercises and option value.
