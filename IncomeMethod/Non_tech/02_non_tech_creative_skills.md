## 💰 PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

AI lets you deliver faster and better - charge for VALUE, not time.

### Package Your Services
Don't sell "a logo" - sell "complete brand identity that attracts premium clients"

### Value-Based Pricing
- A landing page that generates ₹10,00,000 in sales is worth ₹50k+, not ₹5k
- A course that changes careers is worth ₹50k, not ₹999

### Create Pricing Tiers
- **Basic:** Self-service / DIY with your templates
- **Standard:** Done-for-you service
- **Premium:** Strategy + execution + ongoing support

---

## 🎯 CLIENT ACQUISITION STRATEGIES

### 1. Portfolio Before Everything
Use AI to create 5-10 portfolio pieces in your niche (even if fake/practice projects)

### 2. Content Marketing
- Share process videos on Instagram/TikTok
- Write helpful posts on LinkedIn
- Create YouTube tutorials showing your skills
- AI helps you create content 10x faster

### 3. Platform Presence
- **Fiverr:** Start low, collect reviews, raise prices
- **Upwork:** Apply to 10-20 jobs daily
- **Contra:** Modern freelancer showcase

### 4. Niche Down Initially
"AI-powered social media design for fitness coaches" converts better than "graphic designer"
